# Modo-mouse & Modeling Resources

Home of Modo-Mouse and various scripts, macros and configs that will help improve your modelling speed and overall efficiency with Modo.

## Getting Started

Simply download the files and run...
```
Modo-Mouse.exe
```
Configure your Modo hotkeys as desired and import any desired macros for use, see the individual readme files in the macro folders for instrcutions and descriptions on what they are and how to use them.

These are the keys you should map for Modo-Mouse to work as expected:

## Contributing

I'd love for people to contribute, if you feel that you have a macro that is useful, a script that you've made or some suggestions, feel free to reach out and I'll add them with information to the respoitory or you can contribute of your own accord through Github, I'll set something up to handle how you should contribute your macro with relevant information soon enough but for now just use the Modo forum thread to discuss things.


## Authors

* **Patrick griffiths** - *Modo-Mouse & more to come*

If you contribute something I'll add your name here, if the list grows too large I will include contributors that push more to this resource list on here and include the rest in a contributor file.

* If you'd like to see somehing included here but are not the author or the script or macro, pass on the details

## Coming Soon
I'll be including many things over time but very soon I'll include a couple of custom panels, command lists of most commonly used hotkey to command combinations from myself and a couple of users that reply to the forum thread by the time I get to that, improvements to the Modo-Mouse and additional links/resources to alternate solutions that will include an .AHK file for those wanting to use that instead of Modo-Mouse.
