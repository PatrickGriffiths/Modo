# Modo-mouse Alternate Solutions

I know not everybody is happy taking an EXE file and running it or maybe you want to customize something, well I'll include by default an AutoHotkey script that mimics the exact same functionality of Modo-Mouse, and when I get back to using Linux (hopefully sooner rather than later) I'll upload a Linux friendly solution.

If you use X-Mouse or any other solution outside of what is provided, reach out, maybe we can get something set up for the more popular options out there so that people using whatever they're using can just grab the script and get going.

Note that in most cases perhaps not 'all' functionality will be available in these alternate solutions, information on exactly what is and isn't will be included with the readme files on a per solution basis.

## Contributing

Contact me here or via the Modo forum thread for Modo-Mouse and we can talk about getting you on-board with maintaining an alternate script and collaborate on optimizing the functionality over time.
