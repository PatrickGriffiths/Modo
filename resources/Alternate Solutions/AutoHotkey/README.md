# Modo-mouse with AutoHotKey

I'm aware that many of you may be gamers and make use of Autohotkey as a macro and remapping solution so I've gone ahead and created an autohotkey .ahk script with the same functionality as Modo-Mouse, I will try to keep it up to date however the main modo-mouse.exe will be the latest and greatest.

## Current Features

Currently this supports the basic mouse remapping and middle mouse button for select between functionality, I will add the pie menu functions for the relating hotkeys being held down (see main forum post for details) soon enough.
