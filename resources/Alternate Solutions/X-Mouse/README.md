# Modo-mouse Features With X-Mouse

Over on the modo forum post: http://community.thefoundry.co.uk/discussion/topic.aspx?f=36&t=124923 A user ([Zimlorog](http://community.thefoundry.co.uk/community/profile.aspx?name=Zimlorog)) mentioned X-Mouse for Windows and that he linked to a video where Tor Frick gives an overview of how he is faster with Modo through using it, where I won't be able to support 'everything' this looks like many other users may already use it too, I'll try to document everything from Modo-Mouse as clear as possible and perhaps one of you awesome community members can help maintain an x-mouse solution here for others, if not and I find some time eventually, I'll push the updates, but if you want the latest and greatest, Modo-mouse is where it's at until someone takes on supporting this.
