# Modo-Mouse Resources

Useful resources that are not directly related to Modo scripts or customizations will be hosted here, I will also include all documents that list most used commands, suggesting useful commands and hotkey mapping within this directory. As of right now there is a temp image that lists all of the default Modo hotkeys. After the weekend I will have more time to add more in terms of documentation for Modo-Mouse.
